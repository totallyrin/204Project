# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project Final Submission

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2021)!

Our project seeks to apply logic to choosing where to eat.
By taking boolean values for what can be tolerated of a restaurant, we can rule out all of the establishments with the click of a button.

## Structure

* `proofs.jp`: Jape file containing sequents, as well as their proofs.
* `report.pdf`: The text documentation of our project.
* `properties.py`: Holds our dictionary of restaurants. Helper methods to handle abstraction and input.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script. Our propositions and constraints.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
