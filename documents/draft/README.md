# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2021)!

Our project seeks to apply logic to choosing where to eat.
By taking boolean values for what can be tolerated of a restaurant, we can rule out all of the establishments with the click of a button.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders. README.md files are included in both.
* `report.pdf`: The documentation of our project draft.
* `properties.py`: Holds our dictionary of restaurants. Tons of helper methods to handle abstraction and input.
* `properties_sugg.txt`: Rough draft of our ideas. Mostly not yet implemented, a little bit tongue-in-cheek.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script. Our attempts to produce propositions and constraints.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
